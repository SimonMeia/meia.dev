        <p>
            During the 5th semester of the media engineering studies former students came to talk about their
            professional experiences after graduation. For each one of them, the class had to film, take photos and
            wirite a blog post about the talk. I volonteered to take pictures for 2 talks.

            I was in charge of taking picture during an <i>p√©tanque</i> tournament we organized with my friends. I tried
            to capture the emotions and moments of conviviality during the afternoon and it was a very rewarding exercise

            Being the computer manager of the library of my village, I had the opportunity to extend my commitment
